# Project with my lovely Elina
# Overview

This project is a 2D raycasting engine implemented in C. It simulates the rendering of a 3D world in a 2D viewport, similar to classic first-person shooter games like Wolfenstein 3D.
Raycasting is a technique used to create the illusion of 3D environments by casting rays from the player's viewpoint to determine what is visible and then rendering the scene accordingly.

# Features

Map Rendering: Load and render maps from text files, allowing for the creation of custom game environments.
Player Movement: Implement player movement controls (e.g., WASD keys) to explore the 3D-like world.
Wall Rendering: Cast rays to detect walls and render them as the player navigates through the environment.
Minimap: Display a minimap in the corner of the screen to provide an overview of the game world and the player's position.
Textures: Apply textures to walls for a more realistic and immersive visual experience.
Collision Detection: Implement collision detection to ensure the player cannot move through walls or obstacles.
Performance Optimization: Optimize rendering algorithms for smooth real-time performance.
User Interface: Create a user-friendly interface with controls, a minimap, and game information.

# Getting Started

0. Install mlx library
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Build the project with make.
3. Run the executable and enjoy.
4. Use the controls (A, W, S, D, right/left arrow) to navigate through the 3D-like world.
